# Ideas
This is the place for suggesting certain plugins or themes - or looking for ideas to make one!

## How do I do it?
### Submitting a request
Make sure your plugin or theme hasn't already been suggested, you can try searching in the [issues tab](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/ideas/issues) of this repository. The plugin or theme should also be, you know, possible, so make sure to check that that is indeed the case.

  + Server side modifications (ex. Notification mods)
  + Free nitro - Everything except sending emotes and stickers
  + Compatibility layer plugins (Ex. BDCompat) - Plugins will need to be ported in order to work in the mobile version of Discord
  + Reading messages in hidden channels
  + Logging in as a bot or with a bot token - The user api does not support bot tokens
  + Checking if someone is actually offline or appearing offline

  + Any that add, remove, or move around ui elements - this can only be done by plugins
  + Any that use custom fonts or icons - This requires modifying the app bundle/apk itself

**Failure to stick to the provided template, making duplicate/already existing requests, or suggesting self-bot-like behavior may result in your issue being closed and rejected! If you continue to do this, you will (most likely) be banned from the repo/org.**

## Taking a plugin or theme that's "up for grabs"

If you'd like to take a plugin/theme that's _"Up for grabs"_ and work on it, you'll need to reply to the issue and let us know that's what you intend to do. Once you do this, we'll assign you and mark the issue as _"Work in progress"_ in order to let others know too.

Before you take up a request make sure you have the time or energy to complete it. If you later decide to give up for any reason - please let us know so that we can unassign you and relabel the issue.

### I finished the plugin/theme

For plugins: Make sure to get your plugin proxied, you can do this by submitting a request in the #proxy-requests channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/n9QQ4XhhJP). Once thats been approved just reply to the issue with a link to your plugin and you'll be good to go!

For themes: Just reply with a link to your theme hosted on GitHub, we'll mark the issue as complete and you can carry on with your day!


## I'm really interested in _x_ plugin/theme but I'm unsure how to make one

Just react with a simple thumbs up to let people know you're interested, don't "bump" issues as this will spam emails and make tracking requests more difficult.

Do not spam repo comments asking for progress updates, all of us developers are doing this in our free time - so be patient!
